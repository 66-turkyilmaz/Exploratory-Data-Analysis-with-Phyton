📌 Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

I found a crime dataset on Kaggle and analyzed it using Jupyter Notebook as part of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) study.

The goal of this project was to better understand the structure, patterns, and trends within the dataset.
Some of the key questions I focused on included:

What are the most common crimes by offense group?

Which offense descriptions occur most frequently?

How do crime patterns vary over time and location? 

This project helped me practice data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
